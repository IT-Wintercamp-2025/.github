# IT-Wintercamp-2025
24.02.2025 to 28.02.2025

The purpose of this organization is to organize and manage the individual components like backend, frontend and infrastructure+database for the weekly task of the participants.
The participants, divided into teams, work together on various repositories that represent and encapsulate the individual components.

In order to make the application as easy to use as possible, the components are each integrated as submodules in a central repository [application-dockerized](https://github.com/IT-Wintercamp-2025/application-dockerized), from which a Docker image is built. The image is located within the associated repository.
